Next.js App Router starter with a components-first structure.

## Structure
- `app/`: routes, layouts, and metadata (app router).
- `components/`: shared UI (header, sections, cards, shells) to reuse across pages.
- `public/`: static assets; drop images and icons here.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` – start the dev server on `http://localhost:3000`.
- `npm run lint` – lint the project with ESLint.
- `npm run build` – create a production build.

## Next steps
- Add new pages in `app/` (for example `app/about/page.tsx`).
- Extend `components/` with the UI patterns you want to reuse.
- Update `app/page.tsx` with real content for the first version.
